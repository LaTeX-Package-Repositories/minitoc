The minitoc package is used to add mini-tables-of-contents (minitocs)
at the beginning of every chapter. There is also minilofs and minilots.
At the part level, they are parttocs, partlofs and partlots.
If the type of document does not use chapters, they are
section level secttocs, sectlofs and sectlots.

The (long) history is in the minitoc.dtx file,
as part of the documentation.

The description of all the (many) files in the package and their
installation is described in the INSTALL file and the minitoc.dtx file,
as a chapter of the documentation.
